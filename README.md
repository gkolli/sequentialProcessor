Design and Implementation of an Arithmetic Logic Unit 

For detailed documentation regarding this project, refer to the Sequential Prcessor PDF file. 

To gain a better understanding of computer architecture, I designed and implemented a sequential processor based arithmetic logic unit (ALU). 
The ALU is a combinational digital circuit that computes both arithmetic and logic operations on integer binary numbers.
