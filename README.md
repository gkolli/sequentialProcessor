To gain a better understanding of computer architecture, I designed and implemented a sequential processor based arithmetic logic unit (ALU). 
The ALU is a combinational digital circuit that computes both arithmetic and logic operations on integer binary numbers. 

The ALU is a fundametal building block of the CPU; The control unit of the CPU directs the ALUs to perform a certain operation (based on instructions sent to the processor), with the result stored in registers. This is the crux of CPU operation, and why ALUs are so important. Current CPUs have multive ALUs and thus can carry multiple operations in parallel, driving performance. 

Sequential, or serial, processing executes instructions in the order that they were received, as opposed to parallel processing. The ALU developed herein uses a
